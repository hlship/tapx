Tapx: Tapestry 5 Extensions by Howard Lewis Ship
====

The Tapx modules are a set of extensions to the (http://tapestry.apache.org "Apache Tapestry Web Framework") that provide new capabilities that are not yet available in the main framework.

In some cases, a module exists here for licensing reasons, as it may integrate with an existing library that is not compatible with the Apache Software License.

In other cases, a module represents new functionality that is being refined before moved into Tapestry proper; alternately, it may represent code that is not of sufficient general interest to be part of framework, proper.
