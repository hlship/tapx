  This module patches the version of {{{http://prototypejs.org/}Prototype}} available from version <<1.6.0.3>> 
  (as packaged with Tapestry 5.1.0.5) to version
  <<1.6.1>>. This is very important for compatibility with Internet Explorer 8.
  
  <<This module is not needed for Tapestry 5.2, as that version of Tapestry bundles the latest version of Prototype.>>
